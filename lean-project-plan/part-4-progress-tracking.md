## 4. Progress Tracking Mechanism - Lean Open-Source Approach

### Task Status Tracking

#### Status Categories

- **Not Started**: Task has been defined but work has not begun
- **In Progress**: Work has actively started on the task
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues
- **Review**: Task is complete and awaiting review/approval
- **Done**: Task is complete and approved

#### Weekly Progress Update Checklist

- [ ] Update all task statuses in GitHub and this document
- [ ] Add comments on completed tasks with relevant links
- [ ] Document any blockers encountered
- [ ] Adjust upcoming task priorities if needed
- [ ] Update burndown chart
- [ ] Review conversation quality metrics

### Daily Stand-ups (15 minutes)

- [ ] What was completed yesterday?
- [ ] What will be worked on today?
- [ ] Any blockers or issues?
- [ ] Immediate action items
- [ ] Brief performance review of AI agent
- [ ] Monitor resource usage and performance bottlenecks

### GitHub Project Management

- [ ] Maintain Kanban board: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, Done
- [ ] Update issue statuses daily
- [ ] Link pull requests to issues
- [ ] Use consistent labeling system
- [ ] Track milestone progress
- [ ] Categorize issues by component (Text Interface, Voice, AI, Dashboard, etc.)
- [ ] Add resource usage/performance impact to PR template

#### Issue Template

```markdown
## Description

[Brief description of the task]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Technical Notes

[Any implementation details or considerations]

## Open-Source Dependencies

[List any open-source components this depends on]

## Performance Considerations

[Resource usage estimates, performance impacts]

## Related Issues

[Links to related issues]

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance impact verified
- [ ] PR reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Tested with AI agent
```

### Weekly Demo Sessions (Friday)

- [ ] Prepare demonstration script with specific conversation scenarios
- [ ] Record demo conversations for documentation
- [ ] Assess progress against milestone targets
- [ ] Review conversation quality metrics
- [ ] Gather feedback from stakeholders
- [ ] Adjust next week's priorities based on feedback
- [ ] Document decisions and action items

### Open-Source LLM Performance Tracking

- [ ] Track token generation speed (tokens/second)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during conversation sessions
- [ ] Measure latency for first response
- [ ] Benchmark different model sizes and configurations
- [ ] Document quality vs. performance tradeoffs
- [ ] Track hardware requirements and bottlenecks
- [ ] Compare model quality across different use cases

### Conversation Performance Metrics Tracking

- [ ] Conversation handling success rate (% successfully handled by AI)
- [ ] Average conversation duration
- [ ] Customer sentiment scores
- [ ] Action item accuracy (% of action items that were relevant)
- [ ] Conversation summary quality rating
- [ ] Number of conversations requiring human intervention
- [ ] Conversation categorization accuracy
- [ ] Topic classification precision
- [ ] Entity extraction accuracy

### Resource Utilization Tracking

- [ ] CPU usage during peak loads
- [ ] Memory consumption (especially for LLM inference)
- [ ] Storage usage (model weights, conversation history)
- [ ] Network bandwidth consumption
- [ ] Free tier utilization percentages
- [ ] API call frequency monitoring
- [ ] Estimated cost projection if using paid services

### Documentation Maintenance

- [ ] Update project README with progress
- [ ] Maintain technical documentation alongside features
- [ ] Record architecture decisions in ADR format
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Maintain prompt engineering documentation
- [ ] Document conversation flows and scenarios
- [ ] Catalog product knowledge updates
- [ ] Create setup guide for open-source components
- [ ] Maintain troubleshooting guide for local development

### Weekly Open-Source Dependency Review

- [ ] Audit all open-source dependencies for security issues
- [ ] Check for updates to key components (Ollama, LangChain, etc.)
- [ ] Review license compliance
- [ ] Document any customizations made to open-source tools
- [ ] Identify contributions that could be made back to open-source projects
- [ ] Monitor community discussions for patches or improvements

### Risk Register Maintenance

| Risk ID | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| R01 | Open-source LLM performance inadequate | Medium | High | Benchmark multiple models, optimize prompts, prepare fallback to API | Monitoring |
| R02 | Free tier resource limits reached | Medium | Medium | Implement efficient caching, optimize code, prepare scaling plan | Monitoring |
| R03 | Browser voice recognition quality issues | High | Medium | Implement fallback to text, consider Whisper.cpp integration | Planning |
| R04 | Local LLM hosting instability | Medium | High | Create redundant deployment, implement auto-recovery | To Do |
| R05 | Security vulnerabilities in dependencies | Low | High | Regular security audits, prompt updates | Monitoring |
| R06 | Poor conversation quality with open LLMs | Medium | High | Prompt engineering, fine-tuning, graceful handoff | Research |
| R07 | Asterisk/FreePBX complexity delays | High | Low | Prioritize browser-based WebRTC first | Accepted |
| R08 | Data storage exceeds Supabase free tier | Low | Medium | Implement efficient storage, cleanup routines | Monitoring |

This risk register should be reviewed and updated weekly, with new risks added as identified and mitigation strategies adjusted based on current project status.
